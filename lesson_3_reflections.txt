When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share my repository with others. Or when I want to work on the repository from multiple locations.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If there are multiple people updating the repository, you may not want their changes automatically. You may prefer to wait until you have worked with and tested your own changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    -Branch is still part of the original repository
    -Fork is a copy of the original repository in another place. Mostly static.. On GitHub
    -Clone is an active copy of your repo where you do your work.
    
    You branch to do new work.
    You Fork another repository to GitHub.
    You clone the GitHub repository to your local machine where you do your work.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    You can work on it even if you do not have an active internet connection.
