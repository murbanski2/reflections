When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share my repository with others. Or when I want to work on the repository from multiple locations.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If there are multiple people updating the repository, you may not want their changes automatically. You may prefer to wait until you have worked with and tested your own changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    -Branch is still part of the original repository
    -Fork is a copy of the original repository in another place. Mostly static.. On GitHub
    -Clone is an active copy of your repo where you do your work.
    
    You branch to do new work.
    You Fork another repository to GitHub.
    You clone the GitHub repository to your local machine where you do your work.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    You can work on it even if you do not have an active internet connection.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
    - Source Safe
        Nothing would really be easier
        Harder to merge
        Harder to share long distance
        
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
    - Separate branch when you are making changes that may take some time, or may be experimental.
    - Benefits of working on the master is that it is more straight-forward, easier to commit.
    - Benefits of branch is that it probably works better when you have several people working on the same code.
